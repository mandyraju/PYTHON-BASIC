        "Q1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. A RESTful API is an application programming interface that follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). It enables communication between systems over the internet by using standard HTTP methods (like GET POST, PUT, DELETE) to manipulate resources, which are often represented in JSON or XML.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2.Explain the concept of API specification\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. An API specification acts as a blueprint for an API. It provides a comprehensive, technical description of the API’s operations, endpoints, expected inputs and outputs, error codes, and data models. API specifications are usually written in machine-readable formats (such as OpenAPI/Swagger) and are essential for guiding implementation and ensuring consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Flask is a lightweight web framework in Python that’s known for its simplicity and flexibility. It’s popular for API building because it allows for easy routing, modularity, and integration with extensions (like Flask-SQLAlchemy for databases). Flask’s minimalism makes it fast to set up and easy to customize for both small and large projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "Ans. Routing in Flask is the process of defining how URLs are mapped to Python functions. Using the @app.route() decorator, developers can specify which function should handle which URL path, and optionally, which HTTP methods are allowed for each route.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "ans.\n",
        "To create a simple Flask app:\n",
        "\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route(\"/\")\n",
        "\n",
        "def hello():\n",
        "\n",
        "Run the server using flask run in your terminal after setting the appropriate environment variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful API?\n",
        "Ans. Common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs include:\n",
        "\n",
        "GET: Retrieve data\n",
        "\n",
        "POST: Create data\n",
        "\n",
        "PUT: Update/replace data\n",
        "\n",
        "PATCH: Modify part of data\n",
        "\n",
        "DELETE: Remove data\n",
        "\n",
        "Others include HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, and CONNECT.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The @app.route() decorator in Flask links a URL path to a Python function, turning it into a view handler for that route. It can also specify which HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) the route accepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. GET: Retrieves data from the server. It’s safe, idempotent, and request parameters are sent in the URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "POST: Sends data to the server to create resources or perform actions. The data is sent in the request body and is not idempotent.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. How do you handle errors in Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Flask allows custom error handlers using the @app.errorhandler decorator. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.errorhandler(404)\n",
        "def not_found(e):\n",
        "    return jsonify(error=\"Not found\"), 404\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. You can connect Flask to a SQL database using libraries like Flask-SQLAlchemy. First, install the extension, configure your database URI, and then use the provided ORM to interact with tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension that integrates SQLAlchemy ORM with Flask. It simplifies database connections, queries, and management using Python classes and objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Flask blueprints are a way to organize and group related routes, templates, and static files into reusable components. They encourage modularity, especially in larger applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Flask’s request object gives access to HTTP request information such as method, headers, body, query parameters, and form data for processing incoming data in your route functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Define a route using @app.route(), specify the methods, and implement logic:\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "@app.route('/items', methods=['GET'])\n",
        "def get_items():\n",
        "  pass\n",
        "Q16.What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The jsonify() function formats and returns a valid JSON response with the correct Content-Type. It safely serializes Python dicts and lists for API responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. Explain Flask’s url_for() function\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans., url_for() builds dynamic URLs for endpoints using their function names, making your app more maintainable:\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Flask serves static files from a /static directory inside your project. You access them in templates using url_for('static', filename='style.css').\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. An API specification details every aspect of your API (endpoints, methods, data types, responses), serving as a guide for both developers and auto-generated documentation/tools. It ensures everyone interacts with the API as intended.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. HTTP status codes are standardized responses that indicate the outcome of an HTTP request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server error). They help clients understand the result of their requests and handle errors properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Define a route accepting POST:\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/item', methods=['POST'])\n",
        "def create_item():\n",
        "   data = request.get_json()\n",
        "   \n",
        "   return jsonify(result=\"Item created\"), 201\n",
        "Q22. How would you secure a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans. Security practices include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Validating and sanitizing user inputs\n",
        "\n",
        "Using HTTPS\n",
        "\n",
        "Implementing authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth)\n",
        "\n",
        "Setting proper CORS policies\n",
        "\n",
        "Rate limiting\n",
        "\n",
        "Avoiding sensitive data in GET requests\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. Flask-RESTful is an extension that simplifies building REST APIs by providing class-based resources, automatic request parsing, and integration with Flask, making APIs more readable and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24. What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. The session object stores data across requests for a user by using signed cookies. It’s useful for tracking user state, authentication status, and small pieces of data between requests."
